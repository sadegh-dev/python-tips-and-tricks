"""

    - names of variables and functions are case-sensitive,
     for example the two names Age and age are different.
    
    - names of variables and functions can only 
    contain uppercase and lowercase letters, 
    numbers and _underscore: [A-z, 0-9, _]
    
    - names cannot contain characters, like: !@#$%^&*
    
    - names of variables and functions cannot 
    start with numbers or contain spaces.
     
    - names of variables and functions cannot 
    be reserved names in python, such as: int, str
     
    - it is better for the variable name to describe its contents, 
    the name of the function describes what it does, 
    for example, age is used to store the age of people.
     
    - it is better for variables that are of boolean type, 
    to start their names with is_ .
